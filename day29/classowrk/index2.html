        <h3><b>Education in Programming</b></h3>

        <br>

       <p> I have studied,<i> and continue to study,</i> under the tutelage of Master programmers, Such as: Luka Tskhvaradze and Nika Keshelava</p>
       <p><i><u>For the sake of respect and privacy, i will not be adding their photos. Their names should be enough.</u></i></p>

       <p> I am a diligent student at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nika11keshelava/"> <button><b>Goal Oriented Academy</b></button></p></a></p>

       <p> <b><i>Goal Oriented Academy</i></b>, or <b><i>GOA</i></b> for short, stands out as an online institution dedicated to honing <u>programming skill</u>s in tandem with <u>graphic design</u> expertise. <br>
           This educational platform prides itself on a team of seasoned professionals who are unwaveringly committed to providing top-tier resources and guidance to its students.

           <br />

           One of the <emp>distinguishing features</emp> of <i>Goal Oriented Academy</i> is its remarkable ability to foster rapid skill development among its novice learners. 

           <br />

           Countless success stories abound, where students have ascended through the ranks in remarkably short periods under the mentorship of certain revered masters, <br>
           such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1133392237455746/user/100088419544165"><u><b>Luka Tskhvaradze</b></u></a> <br>
           and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1133392237455746/user/100002588415328"><u><b>Nika Keshelava</b></u></a>. 

           <br>

           In just a matter of <i>weeks</i>, these individuals have transformed from beginners to proficient practitioners, a testament to the effectiveness of the academy's teaching methods.

           <br>

           Moreover, within the academy's community, students have the opportunity to assume <i>leadership roles</i>, earning titles akin to the elder siblings within their respective groups. <br>
           This dynamic not only fosters a sense of camaraderie but also encourages peer-to-peer support and collaboration, further enriching the learning experience at Goal Oriented Academy.</p>
